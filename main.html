                <h3>THE ITALIAN INFLUENCER WHO BUILT A GLOBAL BRAND</h3>

                <p id="chiara">
                    The 31-year-old is founder of theblondesalad.com, a fashion blog that has turned into a 
                    global retail business, with 17m followers on Instagram, equivalent to the population of 
                    the Netherlands. 
                    The capital of her world is Milan, where Ferragni grew up and where she first started 
                    taking photographs of herself outside fashion shows and sharing them with friends. Today
                     her office is across the road from Italy’s famous Palazzo dell’Informazione, the national
                      press tower that once housed some of the country’s best-known newspapers. Ferragni’s 
                      face, she tells me later, will be plastered all over the building as a hoarding during 
                      Milan’s upcoming fashion week, which seems an apt metaphor for what digital has done to 
                      traditional media. But this meeting is not to talk about Ferragni’s rise as a media star.

                <h3>CHIARA FERRAGNI EXCLUSIVE EYEWEAR COLLECTION</h3>
                <p style="text-align-last:auto">
                    Two sophisticated and feminine pairs of urban-style sunglasses in a range of vibrant colors. 
                    The first model, “Cool eye”, is an original spin on the classic cat-eye design and comes in black,
                     pink glitter, neon pink and light blue, while the second model, “Bold eye”, has a long, rectangular 
                    shape with rounded profiles and is available in black, transparent silver glitter and green.
                   The Chiara Ferragni glasses, light and boasting their own inimitable style, are inspired by the 
                   influencer’s passion for fashionable and unconventional designs. The accompanying case perfectly embodies 
                   the DNA of the brand with a pink glitter print, personalized with the famous Chiara Ferragni logo, also 
                   present on the outside of the temples.

This revenue can come from advertisers, brand sponsorships and collaborations with designer brands, including Guess, Steve Madden, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Chanel, Gucci, and Tommy Hilfiger. But Ferragni’s success isn’t just confined to social media. In 2013, Ferragni launched her own footwear line with Luisa Via Roma. Boasting four flagship stores, the Chiara Ferragni Collection has since expanded into a clothing, accessories and children’s wear line. As the first blogger to have ever landed a Vogue cover, it’s no doubt that Ferragni has achieved monumental success in the fashion world."

Chiara Ferragni collection, with the genuine leathers and handmade sewings, is a 100% Made in Italy brand, that can count on the expertise of some of the biggest factories located throughout the country, which are well known for the high craftsmanship. In 2016 the brand moved its first steps towards a global expansion, launching pop-up stores around the world in selected boutiques and department stores."

On May 6, 2017, she got engaged to Italian rapper and singer Federico Leonardo Lucia, famous by his stage name ‘Fedez,’ during his concert in Verona, Italy, which was aired live on the Italian radio and TV channel RTL 102.5. The couple lives in Los Angeles, California. They were blessed with a son, Leone, born on March 19, 2018, and also a daughter, Vittoria, born on March 24, 2021. Chiara’s dog, Matilda, born on July 21, 2010, has become an Instagram sensation after the latter made her Instagram debut in November 2012."
